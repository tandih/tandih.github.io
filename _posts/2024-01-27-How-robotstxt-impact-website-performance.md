A robots.txt primarily used to control search engine crawling and indexing. It can indirectly impact a website's performance......How it is possible ??
 

Ok, let's see 

## What Is a Robots Txt File ? 
-----

The robots.txt or text file instructs search engines and other web robots how to crawl your website’s pages.

It acts as a sentry to your site and if desired can actually block Google and other search engines from indexing content. For example, Facebook’s robots txt file ‘disallows’ all the major search engines from access its content.

Apart from preventing access to every page, you can instruct search engine bots to only scan certain areas. Subdirectories that contain information that you would prefer not to appear in Google yet work in this way.


##  How robots.txt Works
-----
A robots.txt file is a simple text document with no formatting and The basic premise is to allow or disallow access to bots (automated traffic) to areas of your site.

Bots, spiders, web crawlers, and user agents all amount to the same thing — automated traffic.

Bot and web crawlers (such as Googlebot) can visit your site multiple times per day and checks your robots.txt file first. By default, Bot and web crawlers can access all the pages of your website that they find. The robots.txt file tells them not to it.

One side of the note here is the normal visiter wont effected by the robots.txt because they will access the your web page directly.

##  Why the Robots.txt can impact to your web perfomance
-----

Yes, if you read the sessions above you might already understand why it can impact to the web performance. 
If your robots.txt did not configured properly it can not protect the weak area on your website website and the bot and crawler can directly access to this area such as the data form, login page, cart page and checkout page ...etc 

And with the session and concurrent from those bots and crawler it will consume a lot of your resource and the final thing is your website performance

##  Conclusion
-----

Today we can hear the AI anywhere and in all of the meetings and the data is the primary important input for the AI, and one of the data resources for the AI is coming from the automation crawler and bot. Protect your sensitive data and saving your resources is most of the most important thing
